Installation
============

Installing ScaperFC is easy! Just go ahead and run ``pip install ScraperFC`` 
from the command line and you should be good to go!

Examples
========

FBRef
*****

League table
------------

This example shows how to scrape the league table of the 2019-20 English 
Premier League season from FBRef.

.. code-block:: python

    import ScraperFC as sfc
    import traceback
    
    # Initialize the FBRef scraper
    scraper = sfc.FBRef() 
    try:
        # Scrape the table
        lg_table = scraper.scrape_league_table(year=2020, league='EPL')
    except:
        # Catch and print any exceptions. This allows us to still close the 
        # scraper below, even if an exception occurs.
        traceback.print_exc()
        
    # It's important to close the scraper when you're done with it. Otherwise, 
    # you'll have a bunch of webdrivers open and running in the background. 
    scraper.close()

Match stats
-----------

In this code block, we're scrpaing data from an FBRef match page. The example 
I've chosen is So'ton 2:5 Tottenham from 20 Sept, 2020.

.. code-block:: python

    import ScraperFC as sfc
    import traceback
    
    # Initialize the FBRef scraper
    scraper = sfc.FBRef() 
    try:
        # Scrape the match using the FBRef match link
        link = 'https://fbref.com/en/matches/967efd56/Southampton-Tottenham-Hotspur-September-20-2020-Premier-League'
        lg_table = scraper.scrape_match(link=link)
    except:
        # Catch and print any exceptions.
        traceback.print_exc()
        
    # Again, make sure to close the scraper when you're done
    scraper.close()
